        <h2>About the Program</h2>
        <p>The Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering was established in the year 2014 offerng Bachelor of Engineering undergraduate programme. The mission of the department is to enable students become successful technocrats, and contribute to the progress of society. The department has faculty members with specializations in Power Systems, Electrical Machines, Power Electronics, Control Engineering, and Embedded systems and some of them have a rich industry experience also. While the senior faculty members are PhD degree holders, others are actively pursuing research. The department has set up Centres of Excellence and signed MoUs with industry leaders, thereby providing ample opportunities for faculty members and students, to interact with industry experts. Students under the guidance of faculty members take-up project work to gain hands-on experience. Our students have won many laurels in various competitions conducted nationwide. In the ranks announced by Anna University so far, the 2014-18 batch of students secured 8 university ranks. Most of our graduates are placed in reputed companies, and a few of them are pursuing higher studies in India and abroad.
